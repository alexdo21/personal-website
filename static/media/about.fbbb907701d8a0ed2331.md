# Intro
 
I am currently based in the Twin Cities, MN. In May of 2021, I graduated with degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences with a certificate in Mathematics from UW-Madison. During the day I work as a Software Engineer, and at night I like to work on my side projects. For as long as I can remember, I've always had a deep desire to understand how and why things work, specifically as it relates to technology but also in terms of my other passions. My decision to study Electrical Engineering and Math reflects this. I don't want to just learn how to build applications, I want to understand the underlying circuitry and theory about why it works. This website is meant to help me document my projects and help bring all my interests, ideas and pursuits onto one platform.
 
# Software
 
At the time I am writing this, my current growth focus is in software development. My main experiences are primarily in full stack. I first started learning how to build front-end web applications using React. This gave me a lot of experience working with JavaScript. At the same time, I picked up my first back-end framework with Java Spring Boot and my first database with MySQL. I also dabbled in using Node as a back-end server with Express. From there I extended my skills by learning Angular and PostgreSQL during my first internship.
 
Once I became comfortable working with some industry standard technologies, my interest shifted towards less common back-end frameworks and eventually mobile development. I used my side projects as a vehicle to help with this. For example, in my SciPy Suite project, I was able to learn how to build a back-end API using Flask and Python. And in my Stocktracker app, I was able to venture into the world of iOS development working with Swift and UIKit, as well as getting familiar with Firebase and NoSQL databases.
 
In the first year of my career, I regularly practiced and developed my skills in full-stack development. At my current job, I primarily build microservice applications with Java Spring Boot. I feel like this experience has given me a strong foundation into modern Object Oriented Programming and dependency injection principles. I've also gained experience spinning up Docker instances and creating CI/CD pipelines for these applications. However, I am most proud of learning about application security, something that had evaded me since I started programming. For example, I learned how to integrate security with Okta, how OAuth2 works and how it all ties together in an application.
 
An area that I want to really dive into is C/C++ and low-level programming. I've had experience working in these languages before from classes I took in college and reading about them but I've never built a full project out. My next challenge is to build a game using C/C++. I'm excited about the challenge of integrating math and physics into a game and learning how to optimize in a low-level programming environment. I'm also currently learning .NET and C#. I've never used Microsoft technologies before so I hope this journey will open an entirely different world of development for me. Finally, I also want to work more with scientific computing and machine learning tools with Python.
 
# Music and Languages
 
Outside of software development, I spend a lot of my time practicing music and learning languages. Although at first these two subjects might seem completely unrelated, they both require me to reframe the way I think in order to do the same task, which I find incredibly fascinating. For example, whether I am playing the guitar, the piano or picking up a new instrument, I might be producing the same notes or chords, but I have to reframe my approach to consider the instrument's type, timbre and unique features/challenges. Similarly, when I am trying to express my ideas or feelings in another language, I have to shift my thinking to match the language's grammar, syntax and colloquialism for the listener.
 
My musical background includes:
 
- Singing (choir in high school and acapella in college)
- Piano (lessons / self-taught)
- Guitar (self-taught)
 
And I want to pick up:
 
- Drums
- Bass
- Producing
- DJ
 
Languages I know:
 
- English
- Vietnamese (first language and spoken at home)
- Spanish (5 years in school / self-taught)
 
I want to learn:
 
- Mandarin Chinese
- Arabic
- a language with declensions
- an agglutinative language (probably Japanese)
 
I want to be able to integrate these interests with software. I think the intersection between Natural Language Processing and Signal Processing is where I can definitely start investing time towards and hopefully build a career from.
 
# Electrical Engineering and Math
 
On a more technical note, I also want to keep my background and knowledge in these areas fresh.
 
In Electrical Engineering:
 
- Circuit Analysis
- Signal Processing
- Microprocessors
 
I want to learn more about:
 
- Modern hardware and integrated circuits
- Building sustainable electrical systems to combat climate change.
 
In Mathematics:
 
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Differential Equations
 
I want to learn more about:
 
- Statistics and Probability
- Tensor Calculus
 
Not only do I want to be able to do these on regular pen and paper, but I want to implement them in software as well. And I think investing time to learn more about Scientific Computing can help facilitate that.

- Chess
- Football (Soccer)
